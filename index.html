        <h2>Choose your allignment</h2>
        <p>The alignments are usually two words long. Let’s take the example of Lawful Good.<br>The first part of the alignment, ‘Lawful’ describes that alignment’s ethics. The ethics section of the alignment indicates that character’s perspective on society as a whole. Do they respect authority or rebel against it? Do they like order and hierarchy or prefer individuality and freedom?<br>The second part of the alignment, ‘Good’, describes that alignment’s morals. Will they trample on others to get what they want, or do they want to help others? Will they hurt people for fun or will they protect them at all costs?</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Lawful Good</h3>
                    <p> Lawful Good characters always do the right thing as expected by society. They always follow the rules, tell the truth and help people out. They like order, trust and believe in people with social authority, and they aim to be an upstanding citizen.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Lawful Neutral</h3>
                    <p>The Lawful Neutral character does not care about what others think of their actions, they only care about their actions being correct according to their code. But they do not preach their code to others and try to convert them. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Lawful Evil</h3>
                    <p>Lawful Evil characters operate within a strict code of laws and traditions. Upholding these values and living by these is more important than anything, even the lives of others. They may not consider themselves to be Evil, they may believe what they are doing is right.</p>
                </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Neutral Good</h3>
                    <p>While they will generally follow the rules and laws of society, they do so because they lead to good outcomes, rather than because they feel obligated to by authority figures and institutions. A Neutral Good person will break the rules if they are doing it for good reasons and they will feel confident and justified in their actions. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>True Neutral</h3>
                    <p>True Neutral (sometimes called Neutral Neutral) characters don’t like to take sides. They are pragmatic rather than emotional in their actions, choosing the response which makes the most sense for them in each situation. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Neutral Evil</h3>
                    <p>Neutral Evil characters are selfish. Their actions are driven by their own wants whether that’s power, greed, attention, or something else. They will follow laws if they happen to align with their ambitions, but they will not hesitate to break them if they don’t.</p>

                    <h3>Chaotic Good</h3>
                    <p>Chaotic Good characters do what their conscience tells them to for the greater good. They do not care about following society’s rules, they care about doing what’s right.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Chaotic Neutral</h3>
                    <p>Chaotic Neutral characters do what is most likely to ensure their freedom, protect their free will, and get them the outcome they want. That might be a Good action like helping someone, or an Evil action like failing to tell the truth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Chaotic Evil</h3>
                    <p>Chaotic Evil characters care only for themselves with a complete disregard for all law and order and for the welfare and freedom of others. They harm others out of anger or just for fun.</p>

        <h1>Terrain</h1>
